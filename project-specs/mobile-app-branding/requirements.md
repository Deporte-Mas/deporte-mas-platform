# Requirements Document: Mobile App Branding System

## Introduction

The Deporte Más mobile application requires a comprehensive branding system that establishes visual consistency across all screens and components. The branding system must implement the official color palette, typography hierarchy, and design patterns that reflect the Deporte Más brand identity. This system will serve as the foundation for all UI components, ensuring a cohesive user experience that aligns with the brand's bold, sports-focused aesthetic.

The implementation includes defining color tokens for backgrounds, cards, text, and interactive elements, establishing typography rules for titles and body text, and creating reusable styling patterns for buttons and other UI components. Additionally, comprehensive documentation must be added to the README to guide developers on proper branding usage and maintain consistency across future development work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Color System Implementation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized color system, so that I can apply consistent branding colors throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the color system is defined THEN the system SHALL include the following tokens:
   - Background: `#090B1C`
   - Card background: `#111536`
   - Sub-card background: `#1D2255`
   - Text color: `#FFFFFF`
   - Impact colors: `#E12F23` (red) and `#222DC2` (blue)
2. WHEN a developer needs to apply colors THEN the system SHALL provide theme tokens accessible via a centralized configuration
3. WHEN colors are applied to components THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent usage across all screens
4. IF a component requires brand colors THEN the component SHALL reference the theme tokens rather than hardcoded values

### Requirement 2: Typography System Implementation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a typography system with proper font loading, so that text displays correctly according to brand guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the typography system is defined THEN the system SHALL include:
   - Title font: RomaGothic Bold (Adobe Fonts)
   - Body text font: Geist (Google Fonts)
2. WHEN title text is rendered THEN the system SHALL automatically apply uppercase transformation
3. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN the system SHALL handle loading states gracefully
4. IF font loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback fonts
5. WHEN typography is applied THEN the system SHALL provide clear hierarchy between titles and body text

### Requirement 3: Gradient Button System
**User Story:** As a developer, I want gradient button components, so that I can create visually consistent call-to-action elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a gradient button is rendered THEN the button SHALL apply a linear gradient from `#222DC2` to `#E12F23`
2. WHEN multiple gradient buttons exist THEN they SHALL maintain consistent gradient direction and color stops
3. WHEN a gradient button is pressed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
4. IF a button requires emphasis THEN the gradient style SHALL be readily applicable

### Requirement 4: Card Component Styling
**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized card styling, so that content containers maintain visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a card component is rendered THEN the card SHALL use the designated card background color (`#111536`)
2. WHEN nested cards are required THEN the system SHALL provide sub-card styling with color `#1D2255`
3. WHEN cards are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain consistent padding, border radius, and spacing
4. IF cards contain interactive elements THEN the styling SHALL support proper visual hierarchy

### Requirement 5: Background Application
**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent background colors across all screens, so that the app maintains a cohesive visual identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any screen is rendered THEN the screen background SHALL use the brand background color (`#090B1C`)
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the background color SHALL remain consistent
3. IF a screen requires the standard background THEN the background SHALL be easily applicable via layout components

### Requirement 6: Branding Documentation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive branding documentation, so that I can correctly implement branded components without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a developer reads the README THEN the README SHALL include a complete "Branding Guidelines" section
2. WHEN the branding guidelines are reviewed THEN they SHALL document:
   - All color tokens with hex values and usage descriptions
   - Typography rules including font names, sources, and transformation rules
   - Button gradient specifications with color stops
   - Card styling hierarchy and usage patterns
3. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN the documentation SHALL provide sufficient information to implement branded components correctly
4. IF branding rules are violated THEN the documentation SHALL make the correct approach clear

### Requirement 7: Theme Configuration Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want branding integrated with React Native styling systems, so that I can easily apply branding to any component.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN components are styled THEN the branding system SHALL integrate with existing React Native styling approaches
2. WHEN theme tokens are accessed THEN they SHALL be type-safe and provide autocomplete support
3. IF the styling approach uses theme context THEN the branding tokens SHALL be available via theme hooks
4. WHEN applying styles THEN the developer SHALL have a clear, consistent API for accessing brand colors and typography

### Requirement 8: Status Bar and System UI Consistency
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system UI elements to match the app's branding, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the app is launched THEN the status bar SHALL use light content style (white text/icons)
2. WHEN the status bar background is visible THEN it SHALL use the brand background color
3. WHEN system UI elements are displayed THEN they SHALL complement the dark brand aesthetic
4. IF the platform supports it THEN the navigation bar SHALL also follow branding colors

## Success Criteria

The branding system implementation will be considered successful when:
- All color tokens are centrally defined and consistently applied
- Typography loads correctly with proper fallbacks and transformations
- Gradient buttons render consistently across all platforms
- Card components follow the established hierarchy
- README documentation provides clear, comprehensive branding guidelines
- Existing components can easily adopt the branding system
- New components can be created following the branding patterns
- The app presents a cohesive, professional visual identity aligned with reference designs
